                        The often heard phrase “city of contrasts” rings true when it’s said of Rio de Janeiro. 
                        A city that is as defined by its natural wonders and striking beaches as it is by its complex urban life, 
                        it is a place that offers a bounty of experiences for the intrepid traveler. If breathtaking beauty is not enough, 
                        here are some reasons why you should visit Rio de Janeiro at least once in your lifetime.
                        <br> <br>
                        Amazing Hikes <br>
                        Littered with rocky peaks and imposing mountains, Rio de Janeiro and its surrounding land have a wonderful 
                        array of hikes. Forest trails deliver enchanting tropical scenery with broad palms and towering trees, with 
                        the occasional marmoset jumping through the canopies overhead. All the hikes offer spellbinding views over 
                        the city, showing the extent of the urban–nature blend that defines Rio.
                        <br> <br>
                        Stunning Coastlines <br>
                        Having a slice of tropical beach on your doorstep is one of the key appeals of Rio. The most famous beaches 
                        are Copacabana and Ipanema, and each one has its own defining characteristics and features. Copacabana is a 
                        whirl of activity, with large family units enjoying the sun, beach vendors selling food and souvenirs, and 
                        couples playing sports. Ipanema is popular with a younger, body-conscious crowd who go to socialize and tan. 
                        Head to Prainha or Joatinga for a more off-the-beaten-path beach experience.
                        <br> <br>
                        Incredible Views <br>
                        For wide, open viewpoints that offer views of lakes, tropical forests, golden coastlines, and a sprawling city, 
                        there are few places in the world better to go to than Rio de Janeiro. The rocky peaks afford great viewpoints f
                        rom Corcovado and the Sugarloaf mountain. To see the city from all angles, head to Pedra da Gavea, Vista Chinesa,
                         and Mirante Dona Marta for different, yet equally spectacular, views. 
                        <br> <br>
                        Delicious Food <br>
                        For foodie globetrotters, Rio de Janeiro offers a wealth of different food that is a source of local pride, 
                        yet barely registers on the global cuisine scene. Social activities and daily routines are often centered around 
                        food, such as stopping at a padaria (bakery) for a strong black coffee and toasted bread in the morning, and 
                        returning later to grab a refreshing acai after spending some time at the beach. Brazilian bar snacks go
                         hand in hand with a chilled beer; dried meat, deep-fried cassava, and generously filled prawn pastries are t
                         ypical nibbles. Feijoada (a bean stew with chunks of meat) and the famous Brazilian barbecues are highlights
                          of Brazilian cuisine.
                        <br> <br>
                        Friendly People<br>
                        It’s a generalization, yet it contains plenty of truth: Brazilians are mostly exceptionally welcoming people, 
                        and genuinely love to meet people from new cultures. Rio de Janeiro, despite the scaremongering in the media, 
                        is a great place for solo travelers. Head to a bar alone and before long, you will have new Brazilian friends who 
                        will treat you like long-lost pals. The social side of Rio is endearing, and the locals’ approach to forming 
                        lasting friendships is touching.

                                 Guanabara Bay. From Praia Vermelha in the residential Urca district, you can take a three-minute cable car

                                    also a very beloved sport for surfing. Cariocas will tell you that Ipanema's vibrant atmosphere is
